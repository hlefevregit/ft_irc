Everything you need to know about how we did this project is [here](https://www.figma.com/board/TEviHsREY663xd6BxfD1UQ/ft_irc?node-id=1-2&t=7nu0W9odqgLg8YLp-1) 

This is a figjam board, where you can see how the project is splitted. There is also a part LEXIQUE, where everything you need to know about IRC portocole and sockets uses are explained.

This is for educationnal purpose. Please don't copy and paste the code and search for other sources if you are doing this project. There is a credits part, that is where I learn everything, in a blue case on the bottom right of the canva
